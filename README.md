# Intro to Computer Science II - MP3 Player Final Project

A repository containing all files for my final Java project for the Introduction to Computer Science II class that I took in Fall Semester 2017 at USF.

## To Compile and Run:
1. Make sure all .java and .jar files are stored in the same directory
2. Add the JLayer and JAudiotagger .jar files into classpath before compilation
3. Compile all .java files
4. Run MusicPlayerDriver with an argument specifying the absolute path where the MP3 files you wish to use are stored
5. For example: `java MusicPlayerDriver /Users/gphendry/mymusic`
